We also may use demographic and preference information to allow advertising related to ADVENT products and services to be targeted to the users for whom they are most pertinent. This is designed so that users will see advertising that is most likely to interest them, and advertisers can display their ads to people who are most likely to be receptive.</p>

            <li>To act on a good faith belief that access or disclosure is necessary to protect the safety of our associates, customers or the public.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Please note that the Sites may include links or otherwise refer to third-party websites whose privacy practices may differ from our privacy practices.

            <p>Visitors to our Sites use different web browsers and different computers. To make your visits as easy as possible with the technology you use, we may automatically keep track of the type of browser (e.g., Internet Explorer) and operating system (e.g., Windows, Mac) used by a visitor, and the domain name of the visitor's Internet service provider. We may also track the total number of visitors to our Sites in an aggregate form to allow us to update and improve our Sites. This data tells us if more visitors prefer certain features or areas to others, which helps us keep our Sites fresh and interesting to the majority of our visitors. </p>
	          <h3>How do we use cookies to personalize your experience at our sites?</h3>
            <p>Cookie technology helps us deliver content tailored to a visitor’s interests, and allows us to make ordering products, entering and participating in sweepstakes and contests, and offering other functions at our sites easier for our visitors. Sites that offer online shopping use cookies to remember and process the items in your shopping cart, for example. Where appropriate under our disclosed practices and policies, we may associate Personal Information with a cookie file in such instances.</p>

	          <h3>Different types of cookies used by us</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Strictly necessary cookies let you move around the Site and use essential features. These cookies don't gather any information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you've been on the Internet.</li>
              <li>Performance cookies collect information about how you use our Site, e.g., which pages you visit, and if you experience any errors. These cookies don't collect any information that could identify you – all the information collected is anonymous and is only used to help us improve how our Site works, understand what interests our users, and measure how effective our advertising is.</li>
              <li>Functionality cookies may be used to provide services or to remember settings to improve your visit.</li>
              <li>Targeting cookies may linked to services provided by third parties, such as 'Like' buttons and 'Share' buttons. The third party provides these services in return for recognizing that you have visited our Site. </li>
            </ul>
	          <h3>What are web beacons and how do we use them?</h3>
            <p>Some of our Site pages and e-mail updates may contain electronic images called Web beacons, sometimes known as one pixel GIFs, clear GIFs or pixel tags. On Sites, these allow us to count visitors who have viewed our pages. In promotional e-mail messages/newsletters, they allow us to count how many subscribers have read them. Web beacons allow us to develop statistical information about the activities and features that most interest our consumers for the purpose of providing more personalized content. They are not used to access your Personal Information without your consent.</p>
	          <h3>How can you opt-out of cookies?</h3>
            <p>If you don't want cookies, you can set your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or turn off all cookies through your browser (e.g., Internet Explorer or Firefox). Check your browser HELP menu to learn the correct way to change or update your cookies. Alternatively, you may wish to visit other sources which contain comprehensive information on how to do this on a wide variety of browsers. You can also look up details on how to delete cookies from your computer as well as more general information about cookies. For information on how to do this on the browser of your mobile phone you will need to refer to your handset manual. Please be aware that restricting cookies may impact the functionality of ADVENT Sites.</p>
	          <h3>How We Respond to Do-Not-Track Disclosures</h3>
            <p>We do not support “Do Not Track” browser settings and do not currently participate in any Do Not Track frameworks that would allow us to respond to signals or other mechanisms from you regarding the collection of your Personal Information.</p>
	        <h2>SMS Policy</h2>
          <p>Our Sites may give you options to opt-in to text-based or SMS messages on your mobile or smart phone. This Section provides information on how to opt-out of receiving future text messages from us and other helpful information related to our text message services. For any questions not answered in this Privacy Policy, please contact us directly at <a href="mailto://privacy@adventmovespeople.com">privacy@adventmovespeople.com</a>. Participation in our text message list is based on user opt-in. Therefore, at any time from your mobile device, you can reply ‘STOP’ to cancel all future text messages. To ‘opt-in’ means you are consenting to join our text messaging list. This can be done by sending a text message, as directed by applicable marketing materials you may receive, or by entering your phone number into a web-based form online. This action signifies that you have asked to receive a text message from us (i.e. you have given your consent for ADVENT to send messages to you). If you ‘opt-out’ it means that you have decided to discontinue receiving messages from us and have affirmatively asked us to remove you from our list of text message recipients. You can do this quickly and simply by replying to any text message we send with the word ‘STOP.’ There are several ways to stop SMS message deliveries from reaching your phone. The easiest way is to reply ‘STOP’ to any text message you receive. You can also remove SMS subscriptions by contacting us directly at: <a href="mailto://privacy@adventmovespeople.com">privacy@adventmovespeople.com</a>. Please note: to ensure you continue to receive text messages of interest, your choice to opt-out of receiving text messaging from one of our affiliates may not cause our other affiliates to discontinue sending you messages. If you would like to discontinue all messages from all affiliates, please contact us at <a href="mailto://privacy@adventmovespeople.com">privacy@adventmovespeople.com</a>. Pricing for SMS message delivery to mobile devices is based on your text message plan with your wireless carrier. This may be reaffirmed by the following or similar language included with SMS subscription confirmation messages and other messages sent from ADVENT: “Std. msg & data rates apply”.</p>

	        <h2>What are your California Privacy Rights?</h2>
          <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us using the contact information provided below and put “Data Subject Request” in the subject line of your request.</p>
          <p>California law affords residents of California certain additional rights:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The right to know, through a general privacy policy and with more specifics available upon request, what Personal Information a business has collected about them in the preceding 12 months, what it is being used for, whether it is being disclosed or sold, and to whom it is being disclosed or sold;</li>
            <li>The right to “opt out” of processing or allowing a business to sell their Personal Information to third parties (or, for consumers who are under 16 years old, the right not to have their Personal Information sold absent their, or their parent’s, opt-in);</li>
            <li>The right to have a business delete their Personal Information, with certain exceptions as provided by law; and</li>
            <li>The right to non-discrimination to receive equal service and pricing from a business, even after exercising your rights.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>California consumers can make a request related to the above noted rights by emailing <a href="mailto://privacy@adventmovespeople.com">privacy@adventmovespeople.com</a>. Note that there are restrictions regarding the number of times you can exercise these rights. You may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf.
